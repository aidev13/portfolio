            <p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. I am 37 years old, and I have a beautiful wife and daughter. I started out my career like most peopleâ€”graduating high school and rolling into college without a clue in the world what I was going to be doing. It was my first year of college in 2004 when I first encountered the world of "coding". Then life had its' twists and turns, and now, in 2023, 19 years later, I am back at it and loving it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I spent the last 19 years of my career attempting to go to college in another direction. I wanted to be a pilot, so I attended Spartan College of Aeronautics in Tulsa, OK, but my interest was short-lived due to my medical issues (hearing), which disqualified me from flying. I then attempted to go back to school for engineering, but I found it rather boring. Since then, I have worked odd jobs until I caught on to the low-voltage security field, which I have been doing for the last 9 years. I have taught myself everything I know through trial and error and have been very successful.</P>
            <br>
            <p>In 2022, I took on a marketing job that entailed graphic design and website development using third-party sites such as Squarespace and Wix. As I learned more and more about SEO and marketing in general, I soon started to realize all the missing pieces that were not being implemented on such platforms. I found myself asking, "Why this, why that? My interest in full-stack development then sparked again, and now I'm here to build a new career in something I really enjoy: building code and solving issues!</p>
            <br>

        <h3>HTML Fun Facts</h3>
        <br>

        <h3>CSS Fun Facts</h3>
        <br>
        <p>With CSS we can make better backgrounds. So backgrounds not any more need to be boring and static. Previously, we needed some additional programming and scripting, but now this can easily be done with CSS3.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript Fun Fact</h3>
        <br>
        <p>JavaScript was written in just 10 days! - Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

      <p>In Project 1, we aimed to create a real-case app called Travel Assisitance. In Version 0.1, the app allows users to add two inputs - one for their start location and one for their end location. This will then fetch data from two APIs showing the distance and time between two locations and the current weather of both locations.</p>
